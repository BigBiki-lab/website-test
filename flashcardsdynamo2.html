    { question: "How can the output voltage of a dynamo be increased?", answer: "Increase rotation speed or magnetic field strength." },
    { question: "What happens if the dynamo stops rotating?", answer: "No voltage is induced." },
    { question: "Where are dynamos commonly used?", answer: "Bicycle lights." },
    { question: "What is the key difference between a dynamo and an alternator?", answer: "A dynamo produces DC, an alternator produces AC." },
    { question: "Why are carbon brushes made of carbon?", answer:"Carbon conducts electricity and reduces friction." },
    { question: "What happens to the induced voltage if the dynamo spins faster?", answer:"The induced voltage increases." },
    { question: "What would happen without a split-ring commutator?", answer:"The current would alternate direction." },
    { question: "Why does a dynamo need a magnetic field?", answer:"To induce a voltage in the coil." },
