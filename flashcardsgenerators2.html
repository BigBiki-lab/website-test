    { question: "What happens if the coil stops rotating?", answer: "No voltage is induced." },
    { question: "What type of current is used in the UK mains supply?", answer: "Alternating current (AC)." },
    { question: "What does the size of the induced current depend on?", answer: "Speed of rotation, number of turns of wire on the coil and magnetic field strength." },
    { question: "What happens when the direction of rotation is reversed?", answer: "The direction of the current reverses." },
    { question: "What does a turbine do in a power station?", answer:"Spins the generator." },
    { question: "What is the role of carbon brushes?", answer:"To transfer current from the slip rings to the external circuit." },
    { question: "Why are carbon brushes made of carbon?", answer:"Carbon conducts electricity and reduces friction." },
