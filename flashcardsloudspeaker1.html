    { question: "What type of current is used in a loudspeaker?", answer: "Alternating current (AC)." },
    { question: "What happens when a current flows through the speaker coil?", answer: "A magnetic field is produced." },
    { question: "What two magnetic fields interact in a loudspeaker?", answer:"The coil’s field and the permanent magnet’s field." },
