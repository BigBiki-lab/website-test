    { question: "What is red shift?", answer: "The increase in wavelength of light from an object moving away from us, making the light shift towards the red end of the spectrum." },
    { question: "What does red shift tell us about galaxies?", answer: "Most galaxies are moving away from us." },
    { question: "What does a greater red shift mean?", answer: "The galaxy is moving away faster." },
    { question: "How does red shift provide evidence for the Big Bang?", answer: "It shows the universe is expanding, suggesting it began from a single, extremely small and dense point." },
    { question: "What is the Doppler effect in light?", answer:"Light waves stretch (red shift) if the source moves away, or compress (blue shift) if it moves towards us." },
    { question: "What part of the electromagnetic spectrum is red light?", answer:"Long-wavelength, low-frequency light." },
    { question: "What is blue shift?", answer:"A decrease in wavelength when an object moves towards us." },
    { question: "What is the overall conclusion astronomers draw from red-shift observations?", answer:"The universe is expanding, and distant galaxies are receding in all directions." },
