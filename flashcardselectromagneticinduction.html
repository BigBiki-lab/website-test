    { question: "What happens when you move a wire in a magnetic field?", answer: "A voltage/current is induced in the wire." },
    { question: "How can you induce an electric current in a coil of wire?", answer: "Move a magnet into it/move it over a magnet." },
    { question: "What must change to induce a voltage?", answer: "The magnetic field or the motion of the conductor." },
    { question: "How can you increase the induced voltage?", answer: "Move the magnet faster or use a stronger magnetic field." },
    { question: "What happens if the magnet is stationary next to a coil?", answer:"No voltage is induced." },
    { question: "What is the unit of induced voltage?", answer:"Volts (V)" },
    { question: "What is the direction of the induced current determined by?", answer:"The direction of movement and the magnetic field direction." },
    { question: "What happens to the induced voltage if the magnet is moved faster?", answer:"The induced voltage increases." },
