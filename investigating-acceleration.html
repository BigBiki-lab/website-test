<h1>INVESTIGATING ACCELERATION</h1>
<img src="images/investigating-acceleration.png" alt="investigating acceleration photo">
<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>Investigate the relationship between force, mass and acceleration by varying the masses added to trolleys.</p>
<h2>Your task</h2>
<p>You are going to use trolleys as a model of a motorbike to investigate the effect that mass and force have on acceleration. The force will be provided by masses hanging on a string. You can vary the mass of the trolley by adding stacking masses to it.</p>
<h2>Method 1</h2>
<p> A) Prop up one end of the ramp and place a trolley on it. Adjust the slope of the ramp until the trolley just starts to move on its own. Gravity pulling the trolley down the slope is now slightly greater than the friction in the trolley's wheels. Keep the ramp at this slope for the whole investigation.</p>
<p style=" color: #1AA260;"> B) Stick a piece of card to the top of the trolley using sticky putty. Leave enough space to stack some masses on top of the trolley. Measure the length of the card and write it down.</p>
<p> C) Find the mass of the trolley and write it down.</p>
<p style=" color: #1AA260;"> D) Fasten the pulley at the bottom end of the ramp, and arrange the string and masses as shown on diagram B.</p>
<p> E) Set up two light gates, one near the top of the ramp and one near the bottom. Adjust their positions so that the card on the top of the trolley passes through each gate as it runs down the ramp.</p>
<p style=" color: #1AA260;"> F) Put a mass on the end of the string. You will keep this mass the same for all your tests. You will have to decide what mass to use.</p>
<p> G) Release the trolley from the top of the ramp and write down the speed of the trolley (from the datalogger) as it passes through each light gate. Also write down the time it takes for the trolley to go from one light gate to the other.</p>
<p style=" color: #1AA260;">H) Put a mass on the top of the trolley. Keep the masses on the end of the string as they were before. Repeat step G. </p>
<p> I) Repeat step G for other masses on the trolley. You will have to decide what masses to use, how many different masses you are going to test, and whether you need to repeat any of your tests.</p>
<h2>Method 2 - steps H and I for the Exam-style questions</h2>
<p>The steps above are investigating how the mass of the trolley affects the acceleration.</p>
<p> If you wish to investigate the effect of force on acceleration, you need to keep the mass the same.</p>
<p> However, the masses on the end of the string are also accelerating, along with the trolley, and it is the overall mass that you need to keep the same.</p>
<p>You can do this by starting with a stack of masses on the trolley.</p>
<p>Take one mass off the trolley and hang it on the end of the string.</p>
<p>Then follow step G to measure acceleration.</p>
<p>Now transfer another mass from the trolley to the end of the string and find the acceleration again.</p>
<p>Keep doing this until all the masses that started on the trolley have been transferred to the end of the string.</p>
