    { question: "What type of energy change occurs in a generator?", answer: "Kinetic → electrical." },
    { question: "What causes a voltage to be induced in a generator?", answer: "A coil moving through magnetic field." },
    { question: "What two main parts are needed for a generator?", answer: "A magnetic field and a rotating coil." },
    { question: "What type of current is produced by a simple generator?", answer:"Alternating current (AC)." },
    { question: "What happens to the current every half turn of the coil?", answer:"It reverses direction." },
    { question: "What provides the magnetic field in a generator?", answer:"Permanent magnets or electromagnets." },
