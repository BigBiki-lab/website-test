    const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the motor effect?", answer: "The force experienced by a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field." },
    { question: "What does the direction of the force in the motor effect depend on?", answer: "The direction of the current, the magnetic field, and the angle between them." },
    { question: "What is the formula for the force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field?", answer: "F = BIL; Where: F = force (N); B = magnetic flux density (T); I = current (A); L = length of wire in the magnetic field (m)" },
    { question: "How can you determine the direction of the force in the motor effect?", answer: "Use the Fleming’s Left Hand Rule: Thumb = Force; First finger = Magnetic field (north to south); Second finger = Current (positive to negative)" },
    { question: "What happens when you increase the current in the motor effect?", answer:"The force on the wire increases." },
    { question: "What happens if you reverse the direction of the current in the motor effect?", answer:"The direction of the force reverses." },
    { question: "How does the magnetic field strength (B) affect the force in the motor effect?", answer:"A stronger magnetic field produces a larger force." },
    { question: "What is an example of the motor effect in everyday life?", answer:"The operation of electric motors, such as in fans, washing machines, or electric cars." },
